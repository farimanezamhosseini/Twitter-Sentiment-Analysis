**Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data**

***Project Overview***

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify messages into five sentiment categories. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, the model processes text data to provide insights into public sentiment expressed in tweets.

***Key Features***
Multi-Class Sentiment Classification: Classifies messages into five sentiment categories, enhancing the understanding of public opinion.
Text Preprocessing: Comprehensive steps for cleaning and preparing text data, ensuring high-quality input for the model.
LSTM Implementation: Utilizes LSTM architecture for effective handling of sequence data, capturing context in messages.
Performance Optimization: Employs accuracy metrics and parameter tuning to enhance model performance.

***Dataset***

The dataset used in this project consists of tweets labeled with sentiment categories. It includes:

Sentiment Labels: Numeric labels corresponding to five sentiment categories.
Text Content: The actual messages or tweets to be analyzed.

***Code Explanation***

***Data Preprocessing***

Cleaning: The text data is cleaned by removing special characters and converting it to lowercase.
Tokenization and Vectorization: Messages are tokenized and converted to numerical format using the TF-IDF method, transforming the text into a suitable input for the model.
Model Architecture
LSTM Layers: The model consists of embedding layers followed by LSTM layers that process the sequential nature of text data.
Dropout Layers: Included to mitigate overfitting during training.
Output Layer: A dense layer with softmax activation to predict sentiment categories.
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the prepared dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.
Training history is plotted to visualize accuracy over epochs, providing insights into model learning.

***Conclusion***

This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques and LSTM architecture in sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights into public sentiment expressed in tweets. The results can be beneficial for various applications, such as market research, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.
